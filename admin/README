This directory contains files needed to generate datasources for the GOLayout plugin. 
 * GO-Elite.zip - Use this application to process OBO files into useful files
 
 === GO-Elite ===
 This application will produce 3 types of files:
  * Path file - GO IDs and their tree paths, e.g., 1.3.2.2
  * Name file - GO IDs and their descriptive names, e.g., biological process
  * Mapping file - Ensembl IDs and lists of GO IDs from each of the three main branches
  
  Note that the Mapping file is species specific; you need to generate one per supported 
  species. The other files are universal and can be generated for any ontology (not just GO)
  via the OBO file format.
  
  Here's how to do it:
  1. Unzip the GO-Elite.zip file
  2. Open a command line terminal in the expanded GO-Elite directory
  3. Locate the URL for the OBO file you want to process, e.g.:
     	http://www.geneontology.org/GO_slims/goslim_generic.obo
     	http://www.geneontology.org/GO_slims/goslim_pir.obo
  4. Run the following commands:
  		>python GO_Elite.py --update GO --OBOurl  URL
		>python GO_Elite.py --update Official --version EnsMart## --species Sc --buildNested yes
	Where "URL" is your OBO url (see step 3) and "##" is the version of EnsMart you want to use 
	(see the supported versions here http://www.altanalyze.org/archiveDBs/Databases/)
  5. Go to OBO>builds to find the Path file (built_go_paths.txt) and Name file (go_annotations.txt)
  6. Next, run these pair of commands per species, e.g., Mm:
  		>python GO_Elite.py --update Official --version EnsMart## --species Mm --buildNested yes
    	>python GO_Elite.py --species Mm --update GORelationships
    The first one is the same as in step 4, but you have to rerun it per species you want. Again,
    replace "##" with the version number like in step 4.
  7. Now in OBO>builds you'll find a new Mapping file per species.
  
  === Non-GO ontologies ===
  You can still generate the Path and Name files using steps 1-5 above. Y ou'll have to find 
  another source for generating Mapping files, or users will have to provide their own annotations 
  or mapping files themselves.
